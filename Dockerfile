# Alpine rather than distroless/static, for one reason: /addsticker transcodes
# video and GIF sources to WEBM/VP9, which needs ffmpeg. Telegram accepts no
# other codec for a video sticker, Go's standard library has no VP9 encoder
# (golang.org/x/image/vp8 decodes only), and the binary is built CGO_ENABLED=0
# so a cgo encoder would not link either. ffmpeg is therefore a hard runtime
# dependency, and distroless/static has no way to carry it.
#
# ffmpeg comes from Alpine's own package rather than a third-party static-ffmpeg
# image, keeping the supply chain to bases already trusted by this build.
